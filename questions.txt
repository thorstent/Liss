1. What will happen with constraints that span over iterations
2. What if there are contradicting constraints
3. Performance problems (with locks we converged faster)
4. Performance problems because we have the yields everywhere

Problems with current approach:
a) Often only one arrow
b) Locks may span over several iterations

Idea:
- Find atomic sections
-> Find what could violate the atomic section to provoke a bad trace
- Find context switches that could help
->
