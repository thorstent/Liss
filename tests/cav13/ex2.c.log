0-no(init_sem)[ex2.c:24]
1-wa(init_sem)[ex2.c:44]
1-r(hw_start)[ex2.c:29]
0-w(hw_start)[ex2.c:38]
Find all sequential traces
Find concurrent traces that are not sequential
All bad traces: 
(*) 1-r(hw_start)[ex2.c:29] < 0-w(hw_start)[ex2.c:38] /\ 0-no(init_sem)[ex2.c:24] < 1-wa(init_sem)[ex2.c:44]
Found constraints to eliminate bad traces
Locks inferred: 
l1 (1-wa(init_sem)[ex2.c:44]-1-r(hw_start)[ex2.c:29], 0-no(init_sem)[ex2.c:24]-0-w(hw_start)[ex2.c:38])
