2-wn(napi_poll)[ex3.c:66]
0-w(shutdown)[ex3.c:18]
2-r(shutdown)[ex3.c:54]
0-no(napi_poll)[ex3.c:25]
Find all sequential traces
Find concurrent traces that are not sequential
All bad traces: 
(*) 0-w(shutdown)[ex3.c:18] < 2-r(shutdown)[ex3.c:54] /\ 2-wn(napi_poll)[ex3.c:66] < 0-no(napi_poll)[ex3.c:25]
Found constraints to eliminate bad traces
Locks inferred: 
l1 (2-wn(napi_poll)[ex3.c:66]-2-r(shutdown)[ex3.c:54], 0-w(shutdown)[ex3.c:18]-0-no(napi_poll)[ex3.c:25])
